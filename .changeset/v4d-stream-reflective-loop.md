V4-D-stream: the reflective `@MainLoop` runtime now streams events live. `AgentRunner` gains a `stream(message, opts)` method that yields each round's events incrementally (the on-ramp for SSE-first apps) while still returning the aggregated result. `run()` is unchanged for callers — it drains the stream internally. Fully backward-compatible: the collect-mode `delegate()` path is untouched.

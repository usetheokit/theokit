/**
 * Shared build helper for tests that assert on `packages/theo/dist/` artifacts.
 * Multiple tests (`theokit-build-succeeds`, `publint-attw-green`,
 * `devtools-entry-dist`) require the same built package — running
 * `pnpm --filter theokit build` from each one races, wiping dist/ mid-read.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - Decide ONCE PER PROCESS whether this run's dist/ is usable, and reuse that decision.
 *  - When it is not, acquire a filesystem mutex and run a single build.
 *  - Other concurrent callers wait for the lock then verify dist/ existence.
 *
 * ## B-M72-01 — why the decision is memoised, measured 2026-08-13
 *
 * The docblock above already warned that concurrent builds "race, wiping dist/ mid-read", and the
 * mutex was written for exactly that. It serialises WRITERS against each other — and that was not
 * the failure that kept happening.
 *
 * `hasFreshBuild()` was evaluated per CALL, against a 10-minute window, and a full suite run takes
 * about that long. So two callers in the SAME run got different answers: an early one saw a fresh
 * dist, passed the check and went off to read it; a later one — past the window — decided it was
 * stale and rebuilt, and `tsup` cleans the directory before writing. The readers were inside the
 * protocol the whole time and the protocol still let dist vanish under them.
 *
 * Measured three times as an intermittent failure of `r3a-emitted-bundle-node-free` and
 * `import-validation` (once with `dist/cli/index.js` simply absent), always green in isolation. The
 * culprit was captured by watching the directory and snapshotting `ps` at the instant it
 * disappeared: `pnpm --filter theokit build` → `tsup`, spawned from this helper.
 *
 * Memoising makes every caller in one run agree. The window still governs a FRESH process, which is
 * what it was for; it no longer governs the middle of a run.
 *
 * ## B-M76-03 — that claim was wrong, measured 2026-08-13 (M77)
 *
 * "Every caller in one run" was false: **vitest runs test files in separate worker processes**, so a
 * per-PROCESS memo makes every caller in one WORKER agree, which is not the same thing. The original
 * failure survived, just narrower — worker A decides dist is fresh and goes off to read it; worker B,
 * started eleven minutes later, finds the mtime outside the window, decides it is stale and rebuilds,
 * and `tsup` cleans the directory before writing.
 *
 * Measured again on the M77 full run: 7 failures across `import-validation` and `devtools-treeshake`,
 * all green in isolation immediately after.
 *
 * The decision is now shared ACROSS processes by a marker file recording which RUN validated dist —
 * keyed by the parent pid every worker of a vitest run shares. Same run ⇒ trust it, no clock
 * involved. Different run ⇒ fall back to the window, which is what the window was actually for: a
 * dist left over from yesterday. No time window can fix this on its own; any window can expire
 * between two workers of the same run, and that IS the bug.

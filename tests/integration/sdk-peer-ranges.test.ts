/**
 * M48 (ecosystem-integration-guarantee) T3.1 — the SDK-family version ranges are CLOSED and
 * aligned to the framework's v4 floor. Guards the drift discovered during discovery: the root
 * devDep pinned a stale `^3.5.0` (so root-level tests resolved 3.5.0, not the framework's 4.0.2)
 * and the `@theokit/sdk-tools` peer was left open (`>=0.11.0`). A closed range is the install-time
 * half of the seam guarantee (the boot check + contract test are the runtime half).
 *
 * ## Rewritten (backlog B-M67-01, item 6)
 *
 * `test_sdk_tools_peer_is_closed_caret` demanded `peerDependencies['@theokit/sdk-tools'] === '^0.11.0'`.
 * Two things changed since, and neither was reflected here: the package moved from optional peer to
 * **dependency** (the `@theokit/agents/tools` subpath does a static `export *` from it — a missing
 * optional peer would break the import), and the line moved 15 minors. The guard went red by default,
 * and a permanently red guard trains the team to ignore red.
 *
 * The property it always meant to express is not the literal: it is that **no SDK-family range is
 * left open**, and that the manifest does not lie about where the dependency lives. This version
 * asserts that, and adds the lens that was missing — a `peerDependenciesMeta` entry with no matching
 * `peerDependencies` entry is inert metadata, a claim of optionality npm never reads.

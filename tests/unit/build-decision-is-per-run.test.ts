/**
 * B-M76-03 — the dist race, third measurement.
 *
 * ## Why the previous fix did not hold
 *
 * B-M72-01 memoised the "is dist usable?" decision and stated that this made "every caller in one
 * run agree". That claim was wrong, and the reason is embarrassing in a useful way: **vitest runs
 * test files in separate worker processes**. A per-PROCESS memo makes every caller in one *worker*
 * agree, which is not the same thing at all.
 *
 * So the original failure survived, just narrower: worker A starts early, decides dist is fresh, and
 * goes off to read it. Worker B starts eleven minutes later, finds the mtime outside the ten-minute
 * window, decides it is stale, and rebuilds — and `tsup` cleans the directory before writing.
 *
 * Measured again on the M77 full run: 7 failures across `import-validation` and
 * `devtools-treeshake`, all green in isolation immediately afterwards.
 *
 * ## The fix, and why the parent pid
 *
 * A marker file records WHICH RUN validated dist, by the parent process id that every worker of a
 * vitest run shares. Same run ⇒ trust the decision unconditionally, with no clock involved. A
 * different run ⇒ fall back to the freshness window, which is what the window was actually for: a
 * dist left over from yesterday.
 *
 * A pure time window cannot fix this. Any window can expire between two workers of the same run —
 * that is precisely the bug — and widening it only makes a genuinely stale dist survive longer.
 */

/**
 * The test owns its OWN marker and never touches {@link VALIDATION_MARKER}.
 *
 * The first version of this file deleted the real one in `beforeEach`, and that single line
 * sabotaged every worker reading dist at that instant — re-creating the race the marker exists to
 * remove, and taking four unrelated test files down with it in the same run. Shared cross-process
 * state is not something a test may borrow, however briefly.

# Changelog

Workspace-level changes for the `theokit` monorepo. Per-package changes live in each package's `CHANGELOG.md` (`packages/theo/CHANGELOG.md`, `packages/create-theo/CHANGELOG.md`).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (Playwright browser tests for default template — Phase 10 T10.1, 2026-05-18)
- **`fixtures/template-default/`** — full mirror of the default scaffold template, added to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so it installs against `theokit` via workspace link. Lives under fixtures because it's not a customer-facing example, it's a test surface.
- **`tests/e2e/template-default.spec.ts`** — 7 Playwright scenarios in real Chromium covering the canonical first-run surface: app shell renders (TopNav + Sidebar + main), regression check that the layout receives `<Outlet />` (the black-page bug from this week), chat composer accepts input and round-trips through SSE, streaming response arrives as 3 events in DOM order, CommandPalette opens via leading-button + Escape closes, keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K) toggles the palette, zero unhandled console errors during a full chat session.
- **Playwright config** — fifth project `template-default` on port 3460 with its own webServer. Full e2e suite now: **20/20 PASS**.
- The spec also serves as a visibility test for the Phase 5 CSRF warn — every chat POST emits `csrf.warn` to the Playwright web server stdout, confirming the warn-first default is active end-to-end.
- Dogfood check #43: validates the spec + fixture + playwright wiring are all committed. Health now **43/43**.

### Added (CSRF warn-first — Phase 5, 2026-05-18)
- **Default CSRF enforcement on `defineRoute` POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE** with three-mode policy: `off` / `warn` / `strict`. Default for 0.2.0 is `warn` — existing apps keep working and emit a structured `{"event":"csrf.warn",…}` log line for every state-mutating request without an `X-Theo-Action: 1` header. 0.3.0 will flip the default to `strict`. The check piggybacks on the same custom-header + Origin defense already used by `defineAction`, so no token state machine is added.
- **`config.security.csrf`** (`off | warn | strict`) — new optional config field, default `warn`. Set explicitly to `strict` to opt into the future default early, or `off` to disable for apps using a non-cookie auth scheme.
- **`defineRoute({ csrf: false })`** — per-route opt-out for legitimate cross-origin POSTs (Stripe webhooks, GitHub webhooks, OAuth callbacks). Does not affect other routes' enforcement.
- **`theoFetch` auto-attaches `X-Theo-Action: 1`** on every non-GET/HEAD/OPTIONS request, so consumer code keeps working when servers flip to `strict`.
- 10 unit tests in `tests/unit/csrf-warn-first.test.ts` covering all three modes + the warn payload shape; 8 integration tests in `tests/integration/csrf-protection.test.ts` covering the end-to-end path through `executeRoute` including the `csrf: false` opt-out and cross-origin rejection.
- Dogfood check #42: validates the full wiring (`enforceCsrf` + schema + `theoFetch` header + opt-out type). Health now **42/42**.

### Added (Pitch + landing copy, 2026-05-15)
- **`PITCH.md`** at project root — landing-page copy for TheoKit, intended for `usetheo.dev` and other marketing surfaces. HERO preserved from the locked narrative in the root `CLAUDE.md` (*"Build the app your agent lives in. Routing, auth, real-time, deploy — wired."*). Opening uses Hermes / Cursor / TheoCode as **honest category framing** — they are agents that live in terminal, IDE, and CLI surfaces respectively; TheoKit is positioned as the framework for the web-app surface where the agent meets paying customers. Includes `## What you'd ship` (6 concrete surfaces), `## Why TheoKit` (comparison table against Mastra, Vercel AI SDK + Next.js, and roll-your-own), `## Feel it` snippet (combines `defineRoute`, `defineWebSocket`, `theoFetch`), and an explicit `## How it works` DEEP DIVE delimiter with full technical reference below.
- **`README.md` — `## What you'd ship` section** inserted between `## What You Get` and the `## How it works` DEEP DIVE delimiter. Six concrete surfaces a TheoKit developer would ship; complements the feature-shaped `What You Get` bullets.
- **`README.md` — `## Why TheoKit` section** inserted after `## What you'd ship`. Opens with the Hermes / Cursor / TheoCode framing, then the comparison table against Mastra, Vercel AI SDK + Next.js, and roll-your-own. Closes with the punch line *"Mastra builds the agent. TheoKit ships the product around it. You can use both."*
- **`README.md` — `## Status` section** added before `## License`, replacing the prior `## Roadmap` checklist. Honest claims: Production for everything shipped (framework, CLI, four templates, four deploy targets, stable public API), explicit "on the roadmap" labels for the agent layer (`agents/` directory), documentation site, OpenAPI generation, and additional templates (auth-basic, stripe-saas).

### Changed (README structure, 2026-05-15)
- `## Roadmap` section removed from `README.md` — its content was consolidated into the new `## Status` section with honest production-vs-roadmap framing per the root `CLAUDE.md` Cross-Project Rule 8 ("Honest claims only").

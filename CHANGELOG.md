# Changelog

Workspace-level changes for the `theokit` monorepo. Per-package changes live in each package's `CHANGELOG.md` (`packages/theo/CHANGELOG.md`, `packages/create-theo/CHANGELOG.md`).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (Pitch + landing copy, 2026-05-15)
- **`PITCH.md`** at project root — landing-page copy for TheoKit, intended for `usetheo.dev` and other marketing surfaces. HERO preserved from the locked narrative in the root `CLAUDE.md` (*"Build the app your agent lives in. Routing, auth, real-time, deploy — wired."*). Opening uses Hermes / Cursor / TheoCode as **honest category framing** — they are agents that live in terminal, IDE, and CLI surfaces respectively; TheoKit is positioned as the framework for the web-app surface where the agent meets paying customers. Includes `## What you'd ship` (6 concrete surfaces), `## Why TheoKit` (comparison table against Mastra, Vercel AI SDK + Next.js, and roll-your-own), `## Feel it` snippet (combines `defineRoute`, `defineWebSocket`, `theoFetch`), and an explicit `## How it works` DEEP DIVE delimiter with full technical reference below.
- **`README.md` — `## What you'd ship` section** inserted between `## What You Get` and the `## How it works` DEEP DIVE delimiter. Six concrete surfaces a TheoKit developer would ship; complements the feature-shaped `What You Get` bullets.
- **`README.md` — `## Why TheoKit` section** inserted after `## What you'd ship`. Opens with the Hermes / Cursor / TheoCode framing, then the comparison table against Mastra, Vercel AI SDK + Next.js, and roll-your-own. Closes with the punch line *"Mastra builds the agent. TheoKit ships the product around it. You can use both."*
- **`README.md` — `## Status` section** added before `## License`, replacing the prior `## Roadmap` checklist. Honest claims: Production for everything shipped (framework, CLI, four templates, four deploy targets, stable public API), explicit "on the roadmap" labels for the agent layer (`agents/` directory), documentation site, OpenAPI generation, and additional templates (auth-basic, stripe-saas).

### Changed (README structure, 2026-05-15)
- `## Roadmap` section removed from `README.md` — its content was consolidated into the new `## Status` section with honest production-vs-roadmap framing per the root `CLAUDE.md` Cross-Project Rule 8 ("Honest claims only").

# Product context

Prepended to your agent's context on **every turn**, and it is the strongest source in the file
layer (priority 60) — nothing else overrides it. That is what decides what belongs here.

> **Not the same file as `AGENTS.md` at the root.** That one tells agents how to work on this
> codebase: commands, layout, conventions. This one tells your agent what your product IS, for the
> conversations it has with your users. If a sentence would help someone edit the code, it goes
> there instead.

**Put facts here, not preferences.** A preference written here wins against every personality, so a
tone instruction in this file quietly makes `usePersonality` do nothing. Tone belongs in
`.theokit/personalities/`; instructions about specific files belong in `.theokit/rules/`.

Keep it short — every line costs tokens on every turn.

## What this app is

Replace this with two or three sentences: what your product does, who uses it, and the one thing an
agent must never get wrong about it.

## Vocabulary

The highest-value section, and the one most projects skip. Define the words your domain uses
differently from everyone else — a model that guesses what "account" means in your system will
guess wrong in a way that reads as fluent, which is the hardest kind of wrong to notice.

| Term   | In this app it means                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| _term_ | _the definition your team actually uses_ |

## Boundaries

What the agent should refuse or hand off, stated as fact rather than as tone. "Refunds are issued
by support, never by the assistant" is a fact. "Be careful with refunds" is a preference, and it
belongs in a personality where a user could switch it.

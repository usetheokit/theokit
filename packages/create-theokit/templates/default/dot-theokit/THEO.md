# Product context

Prepended to your agent's context on **every turn**, and it is the strongest source in the file
layer (priority 60) — nothing else overrides it. That is what decides what belongs here.

> **Not the same file as `AGENTS.md` at the root.** That one tells agents how to work on this
> codebase: commands, layout, conventions. This one tells your agent what your product IS, for the
> conversations it has with your users. If a sentence would help someone edit the code, it goes
> there instead.

**Put facts here, not preferences.** A preference written here wins against every personality, so a
tone instruction in this file quietly makes `usePersonality` do nothing. Tone belongs in
`.theokit/personalities/`; instructions about specific files belong in `.theokit/rules/`.

## Why this file is here and not at the root

On the SDK this project installs (`^4.52.1`, which resolves to a 4.x), `.theokit/THEO.md` is the
**only** path a `THEO.md` is read from — a copy at the project root is read by nothing, silently.

`@theokit/sdk@5` adds a root `THEO.md` (`usetheokit/theokit-sdk#531`) at priority 55, so on that
version both locations work and `.theokit/THEO.md` still wins a conflict. 5.x is currently published
on the `next` channel only, so moving this file to the root would break it for anyone on the default
install — which is why the scaffold keeps it here.

Two more things worth knowing if you do move it once 5.x is stable:

- The root spec sets `followImports: true`, this one does not. `@file` references resolve there and
  not here.
- Keep the pair. `AGENTS.md` is read by Cursor, Copilot and Claude Code as well as by TheoKit, and
  it addresses a different audience — agents that write your code, rather than the agent that talks
  to your users. That distinction survives whichever location this file ends up in.

Keep it short — every line costs tokens on every turn.

## What this app is

Replace this with two or three sentences: what your product does, who uses it, and the one thing an
agent must never get wrong about it.

## Vocabulary

The highest-value section, and the one most projects skip. Define the words your domain uses
differently from everyone else — a model that guesses what "account" means in your system will
guess wrong in a way that reads as fluent, which is the hardest kind of wrong to notice.

| Term   | In this app it means                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| _term_ | _the definition your team actually uses_ |

## Boundaries

What the agent should refuse or hand off, stated as fact rather than as tone. "Refunds are issued
by support, never by the assistant" is a fact. "Be careful with refunds" is a preference, and it
belongs in a personality where a user could switch it.

/**
 * B-124 — a scaffolded product must not load a repository's `.env` unguarded.
 *
 * A project `.env` is untrusted input. It arrives with the clone, it is read before any trust
 * prompt, and locating the credential store is one of the first things a build does. A raw
 * `process.loadEnvFile()` therefore lets a cloned repository set `THEOKIT_AUTH_HOME=/tmp/attacker`
 * and redirect where credentials are read and written — silently, because nothing fails when it
 * works. The first sign is a credential somewhere it should not be.
 *
 * This is not "a consumer built something the framework lacks". It was the framework handing every
 * new product the unguarded version as its starting point, which is why it is pinned in the
 * scaffolder rather than left to each generated project to get right.
 *
 * The guard is `loadProjectEnv` from `@theokit/sdk`: it applies everything else and refuses the keys
 * that decide WHERE the framework looks.

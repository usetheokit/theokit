# @theokit/presenter

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 70a4daa: Presentation layer (M49): new `@theokit/presenter` package — the canonical `AgentOutputEvent` (narrow-waist normalized event) + the `Presenter` Strategy contract + registry + `UIMessageStreamPresenter` (the web surface) + `fromSdk` source translator. `@theokit/agents` now composes its web `UIMessageStream` path over the shared presenter (`presentUIMessageStream`), replacing the inline `translateToUIMessageStream` (removed — the public export is now `presentUIMessageStream`). Behavior is byte-identical (the full existing web test corpus — unit + M1 E2E — passes unchanged against the new path). This closes the web/terminal translation duplication surfaced by dogfooding agent-builder; terminal/JSON presenters follow in M50/M51. No backward-compat shim (owner-approved clean break).

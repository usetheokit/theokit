# `@theokit/agents`

The layer between `@theokit/sdk` and an application that hosts an agent.

The SDK is the **runtime** — it calls the model, dispatches tools, stores the conversation, streams
the response. This package is the **home**: the surfaces an app needs around that runtime — where
credentials come from, which tools are in scope and under what sandbox, when a human is asked, what
happens to a session after it ends.

The division is not stylistic. `@theokit/agents` never re-implements a runtime concern; when it
looks like it does, that is a bug. What it does is **enrich**: adding the object-shaped surface where
there is state or orchestration to hold, and forwarding the rest unchanged.

> **Enriching never reduces.** A symbol the SDK exposes and this layer does not forward is
> unreachable to whoever consumes the layer — and the only legal way out for them is to reimplement
> it. That happened: when `./auth` exported one value against the SDK's nineteen, a downstream
> product rewrote ~120 lines of credential mechanics in the
> repository root now requires a written decision per SDK symbol, so the next gap breaks CI instead
> of quietly costing someone a week.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @theokit/agents
```

Peer dependencies: `zod` (schemas), `react` (only for `./client/react`), `@theokit/http` (only when
you mount HTTP surfaces).

## Subpath map

Twenty entry points. Import the one you need — the barrel is not the API.

| Subpath | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `.` | `AgentBuilder.create()` — the authoring surface — plus the error hierarchy and shared types |
| `./bridge` | The SDK seam — `createSdkAgentStream`, event translation, the agent builder internals |
| `./testing` | Test seams: compiled-agent inspection, mock streams |
| `./sandbox` | Sandbox backends, postures, `sandboxWritePolicy` |
| `./persistence` | Transcript storage primitives forwarded from the SDK |
| `./interactive` | The interactive-shell backend contract |
| `./pty` | The node-pty implementation of that contract |
| `./auth` | Credential store, OAuth/device flow, `resolveCredential`, `assertSecureModes` |
| `./config` | Agent configuration, trust posture, and the instruction tree (`loadInstructionTree`) |
| `./tools` | Built-in tool factories (read, list, grep, git, patch, edit, shell, …) |
| `./client` | Transports for driving an agent from a client |
| `./client/react` | `useAgent` and the React bindings |
| `./session` | Session lifecycle, listing, fork/rewind, transcript GC with a retention floor |
| `./hooks` | The lifecycle-hook engine and its fingerprint gate |
| `./ask` | The human-in-the-loop rendezvous — ask a question, settle it, abandon it safely |
| `./tool-scope` | `bindToolScope` — bind `{projectRoot, writeRoot, sandbox}` once so an unconfined shell is unrepresentable |
| `./mcp-health` | MCP server health probing |
| `./commands` | Command routing and the shutdown/cleanup contract |
| `./doctor` | Environment diagnostics |
| `./usage` | Token and cost accounting |

## The shapes worth knowing before you start

**Tool scope is bound once, not per tool.** `bindToolScope({ projectRoot, writeRoot, sandbox })`
returns a binder; every factory it binds inherits the scope. `sandbox` is **required** — a scope
without one would be an unconfined shell, and making it unrepresentable is cheaper than detecting it.

**Human gates come in three layers, and they compose.** You *declare* which tools need approval on
the builder, the *posture* decides whether auto-approval is even permissible (it carries the sandbox
posture as evidence, so "auto-approve without confinement" cannot be expressed), and the *resolver*
settles an individual request. `./ask` is the inverse channel — the agent asking you.

**Sessions are deleted carefully or not at all.** `./session` refuses to collect a transcript that a
live writer holds, floors both `keepLast` and `maxAgeDays`, and plans before it applies. When your
app knows about live sessions this package cannot see, inject them — protection is additive and
never subtractive.

**Credentials answer two questions.** Which credential to use, and where it came from. The second
matters more than it looks: without provenance, "why is it calling Anthropic?" has no answer in the
data, and a user cannot tell an explicit choice from a precedence fallback.

## What changed recently

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — shipped inside this package, so `node_modules` answers the
question without a round trip to the repository.

For "which symbol delivers capability X, and in which version did it land", the CHANGELOG entry that
shipped the symbol is the answer — every entry names the version it landed in.

## Boundaries this package keeps

- It does **not** call an LLM provider, run a tool-dispatch loop, or own the conversation store.
  Those are the SDK's, and a PR that adds one here is rejected on sight.
- It does **not** depend on the `theokit` web framework. The dependency runs the other way.
- Web Standards over Node APIs inside `src/` — `Request`/`Response`, `fetch`, `crypto.randomUUID`.
  Node APIs live in adapters.

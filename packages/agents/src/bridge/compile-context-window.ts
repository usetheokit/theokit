 * M8-1 — compile `@ContextWindow` metadata into the SDK's `ContextSettings`.
 *
 * Per sdk-runtime.md, the SDK owns session/transcript storage + compaction.
 * The bridge therefore maps the one knob the SDK natively exposes as a budget —
 * `maxTokens` → `ContextSettings.maxTokens` — and reports the strategy knobs that
 * have NO native `AgentOptions` equivalent (`compactionStrategy`, `preserveLastN`,
 * `preserveToolResults`, `preserveSystemPrompt`). Those are surfaced as
 * `metadataOnlyKnobs` so the walk can emit an honest `metadata-only` warning
 * (ADR D2) instead of silently dropping them (G10 — honest enforcement).

// no code could ever produce. Deleted in M76 when knip named it — leftover vocabulary from a deletion

/**
 * M74 — the four strategy knobs were REMOVED, not implemented.
 *
 * `compactionStrategy`, `preserveSystemPrompt`, `preserveLastN` and `preserveToolResults` had no
 * native SDK mapping and were reported as `metadata-only` — honest, and still surface that teaches
 * the wrong thing: a knob a caller can set and that never does anything reads as a feature.
 *
 * Implementing them was considered and rejected on measurement, not on principle.
 * `resolveCompactionStrategy` DOES exist in this package (`loop/compaction-strategy.ts`, delegating
 * to the SDK's `compactTranscript`) — but it speaks a different vocabulary: one named strategy
 * (`token-budget`) parameterised by `keepTokens`. Mapping four invented strategy names onto it would
 * not be implementing the knobs; it would be inventing semantics and shipping them under names that
 * promise something else. That is worse than the honest warning it replaces.
 *
 * The working surface for compaction is `AgentRunner.compaction` / `resolveCompactionStrategy`,
 * where the app supplies its own summarizer and decides WHEN to compact — per ADR D1, because the
 * SDK owns per-turn context.
 *
 * Nothing passed these knobs: measured across `packages`, `tests`, `fixtures` and `examples`, zero
 * call sites.

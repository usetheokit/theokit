/**
 * Per-turn transient retry for the SDK-adapter stream — the seam the SERVED path never had.
 *
 * ## Why `runReflectiveLoop`'s retry does not reach here
 *
 * `AgentRunnerRunOptions.retry` (V4-P) wraps the START of a reflective round in the SDK `Retry`, and
 * that works because a `RoundStreamFactory` is allowed to THROW. This path is a different runtime:
 * `streamAgentTurnInProcess` → `streamAgentUIMessages` → `createSdkAgentStream` runs ONE SDK turn
 * with no loop, and the SDK does not throw a provider failure at it. Measured in the shipped
 * `@theokit/sdk@4.52.1`:
 *
 *  - `agent.send()` resolves BEFORE the model is called — the loop is detached
 *    (`bootstrap()` → `setTimeout(() => void driveLoop())`, `chunk-KELIQH7K.js:7166`). So a 429 can
 *    never surface as a rejected `send()`.
 *  - the loop's own failure is caught (`executeAgentLoop`'s `catch` → `emitErrorEvent` →
 *    `transitionTo("error")`, `chunk-KELIQH7K.js:7239`) and reported as the run's TERMINAL EVENT:
 *    `events()` ends with a `status: "ERROR"` message, and this layer translates that to
 *    `{type:'error'}`.
 *
 * A `Retry.create` around the stream's creation would therefore have been INERT for the exact
 * failure it was asked to cover — it would have compiled, shipped, and never fired. What makes it
 * real is treating that first `error` event as the throw the SDK declined to make.
 *
 * ## Why retrying is safe here, and only here
 *
 * The retry window closes on the FIRST event. Nothing has reached the caller, no `tool_call` has
 * been emitted, and therefore no edit has been applied — the same invariant `startRound` states for
 * the loop ("a transient before any event is yielded is recovered without re-applying an edit").
 * Once one event is out, a failure propagates untouched.
 *
 * That window is not a technicality on this path: when the first LLM call fails, the run's timeline
 * is EMPTY. The loop seeds its `system` + `user` events into the event log and subscribes the live
 * sink AFTERWARDS (`createEventLog(...)` then `events.subscribe(...)`,
 * `chunk-KELIQH7K.js:4824-4831`), so those two are never delivered live, and the terminal
 * `status: "ERROR"` is the first and only thing `events()` yields.
 *
 * ## Why retryability is read off the run, not off the event
 *
 * The translated event carries `retryable: false` for every agent error — `translateStatusEvent` has
 * nothing better to read, since a `status` message is text. Deciding from that text is the heuristic
 * this ecosystem already paid for (M93: `ECONNREFUSED …:443` classified as a 4xx because the port
 * matched). `RunResult.error.cause` is the SDK's own typed error (`script.errorDetail.cause`, set
 * from what the loop threw), so the adapter hands it over in {@link TurnOutcome} and the SDK's
 * `isTransientError` — the default `RetryOptions.isRetryable` — answers from the error CLASS. A rate
 * limit retries; a bad key does not.
 */

/**
 * The box one attempt's typed failure lands in.
 *
 * An out-parameter rather than a return value because the failure is discovered mid-iteration, by
 * the generator that is also yielding events — there is no return channel until it ends, and by then
 * the retry decision is over.

/**
 * M25 (theokit-ai-first) — background delegation + task-completion scoring.
 *
 * Two THIN wrappers over the M12 `delegate` (ADR 0038/0040): no new orchestration engine, no second
 * loop, no new store. `delegateBackground` kicks off a sub-agent without blocking the supervisor and
 * hands back a handle to await later. `delegateWithScoring` runs `delegate`, scores the result with
 * an injected scorer, and re-delegates with the scorer's feedback until it passes or `maxRounds` is
 * hit. The `delegate` implementation is injectable (`delegateFn`) so this is testable without a
 * SubAgent class or an LLM — and so it NEVER re-implements the delegation runtime.

 * scoring loop — the layer's highest-value piece — had ZERO adoption in a product that runs an
 * explicit review pass: it was unreachable from the primitives that product actually holds.
 *
 * An SDK `SubAgent` or `Squad` satisfies this by having `run`. So does a test double, which is why

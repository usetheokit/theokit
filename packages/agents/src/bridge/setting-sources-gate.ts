/**
 * M68 — the trust gate for `settingSources`.
 *
 * ## The defect this module closes
 *
 * `settingSources` enables on-disk config discovery. `'user'` reads `~/.theokit/` — the operator's
 * own machine, which no third party controls. `'project'` reads `<cwd>/.theokit/`, **including
 * `hooks.json`, which executes shell**.
 *
 * The previous API took `readonly SettingSource[]`, and its JSDoc justified the risk this way:
 * *"it is opt-in because `.theokit/` is the app's own repo (informed consent)"*. That premise holds
 * for a web app whose `cwd` is its own deploy. It does **not** hold for the class of product this
 * framework addresses — an agent whose `cwd` is a repository the user just cloned. There `.theokit/`
 * is attacker-controlled content, and enabling `'project'` is remote code execution on the first
 * `build()`.
 *
 * Documenting it did not prevent it. The measured consumer (TheoCode) did not trust the API: it
 * gated from the outside, with a `posture.allows` of its own (`chat.ts:386`, comment B-008). It
 * already **had** the right decision and could not pass it through, because the API only accepted
 * strings. The gate existed on its side and evaporated at the boundary.
 *
 * ## The evidence is the SDK's, not one invented here
 *
 * `TrustPosture` is `@theokit/sdk`'s own trust primitive, and `recordWiring`'s doc says *"a posture
 * is the only thing in this package that retains a capability"*. A bespoke type would make two trust
 * grammars coexist and drift apart (ADR 0063).
 */

/**
 * The framework's capability vocabulary — deliberately a single name (ADR 0065).
 *
 * `allows` is all-or-nothing in the SDK: every declared `K` gets the same boolean. A finer
 * vocabulary (`hooks`, `skills`, `subagents`, `mcp`) would promise the consumer it can gate one
 * without gating the other, and the primitive does not deliver that. An API that suggests a
 * distinction the runtime does not make teaches the wrong thing, and the error only surfaces when
 * somebody depends on the distinction.

   *
   * ## What this does NOT do today, stated here because the field is where it is read
   *
   * **This layer reads the operator's root because of this flag** (B-024). `resolveOperatorRoots`
   * walks `~/.theokit/skills/` and `~/.theokit/agents/`, and the `~/.claude/` equivalents when the
   * `claude-code` dialect is granted — the SAME grant that gates the project's `.claude/` surfaces,
   * never a looser one. Every definition carries the root it came from, so an operator can tell one
   * they wrote for this product from one they wrote for another.
   *
   * The SDK still does not consult `user`: `includesSetting` is called with exactly `"project"` and
   * `"plugins"` — measured against the published `dist`, not inferred. That is why the read happens
   * here. Until B-024 this field described a capability nothing delivered, which is the
   * accepted-and-ignored failure `rules/foreign-config-surfaces.md` exists to remove.
   *
   * The admission already lived in `resolveSettingSources`' docblock, several hundred lines away,
   * while this line described the root as though the flag delivered it. Two docblocks disagreeing
   * about one field is how a consumer reads the reassuring one — and this is the one they read,
   * because it is the one attached to the thing they are typing.
   *
   * ## What the SDK DOES read from `~/.theokit/`, which is the part nothing gates
   *
   * Measured at 5.5.0: `pluginsRoot()` → `~/.theokit/plugins/model-providers`, the provider trust
   * file, the transcript root and the HTTP cache. Those are read UNCONDITIONALLY — no setting
   * source governs them, and this flag neither enables nor disables them. So the honest shape of
   * the gap is two halves, not one: a grant that governs nothing, beside a root that is read with
   * no grant at all.
   *
   * ## Why it is still accepted rather than refused
   *
   * Refusing would be the shape `HookGateUnsupportedError` uses for an unsupported option, and it
   * is wrong here: the measured consumer passes `user: true` on every run, including the
   * untrusted-directory path where it is the ONLY thing granted. A refusal would turn a graceful
   * degradation into a throw for the exact case the flag was designed to survive.
   *
   * Delivering it is not reachable from this layer alone: the SDK builds every root from `cwd`
   * (`projectConfigRoots(this.cwd, …)`, globbing within it, never walking up), so there is no
   * second root to hand it. The remaining options are an SDK-side root or reading and injecting
   * here, the way the reference consumer does. Tracked as B-024.

   *
   * ## Two questions, and which half of this field answers each
   *
   * The SDK's docblock separates them, and the separation is the whole point of `compatSources`:
   * a trust gate answers *"do I trust the code in this directory?"*; importing another product's
   * configuration answers *"do I want it imported into this one?"*. They come apart in the ordinary
   * case, because `.claude/` is populated in exactly the repository one trusts most — for a
   * different tool, by a teammate who never heard of this runtime.
   *
   * So the two are answered by two different things here, and it matters which:
   *
   * | Question | Answered by |
   * |---|---|
   * | do I want the foreign dialect imported? | **declaring this field at all** — omitting is not enabling |
   * | do I trust this directory's code to run? | the `TrustPosture` inside the grant |
   *
   * ## Why the grant is `ProjectSettingsGrant` and not a vocabulary of its own
   *
   * Not because the two questions are the same — they are not. Because a separate grant could not
   * carry the distinction even if it existed: `TrustPosture.allows` is `Record<K, boolean>` and the
   * SDK documents every value as moving together with the level, so a `'foreignDialects'` capability
   * beside `'projectSettings'` would promise an operator they can grant one and withhold the other,
   * and `resolveTrustPosture` would hand back the same boolean for both. That is precisely the
   * failure ADR 0065 exists to prevent, and inventing the second name would commit it while looking
   * like rigour.
   *
   * The consent half is therefore carried by the declaration, which is a real and sufficient
   * boundary: an operator who trusts a repository completely still reads no `.claude/` until they
   * write this field. What the grant adds on top is stricter than the SDK — there, listing a dialect
   * is enough — and the extra strictness is deliberate: this reads a `hooks.json` that executes
   * shell out of a directory that usually arrived with the clone.

 * `"hooks" | "plugins" | "skills" | "subagents"` — note `subagents`, not `agents`.
 *
 * The two unions therefore DIVERGE, on purpose. `commands` is this layer's, because
 * `<projectDir>/.claude/commands/*.md` is read here and never by the SDK. A caller who builds SDK
 * `local` options directly cannot pass a value of this type — `TS2345`, with a compiler message

 * the SDK lacks rather than writing one list beside the other; a hand-copied list goes stale the
 * day a surface is added, which is the divergence #704 existed to remove.
 *
 * `context` is the foreign root's INSTRUCTIONS — `.claude/rules/*.md`. Added ahead of the SDK
 * release that honours it (usetheokit/theokit-sdk#652), and that ordering is safe in exactly one
 * direction: the SDK matches an `import` list PER SURFACE, so a name it does not recognise is never
 * matched and changes nothing. On an older SDK the rules load as they always did; on a newer one

/**
 * A root that some `TrustPosture` authorised — mintable ONLY by {@link resolveSettingSources}.
 *
 * ## Why a brand rather than a check
 *
 * `define-agent.ts` claimed `CompiledAgentOptions.settingSources` "can only ever hold roots that
 * some posture authorized". Measured 2026-09-10 against the emitted `.d.ts`:
 * `setOnce(draft, 'settingSources', ['mdm','team','user','plugins'], 'cap')` typechecked CAST-FREE.
 * A consumer writing a `Capability` — the documented way to extend the builder — reached the field
 * directly, and `project`, the root this gate exists to protect, is one of the two the SDK reads.
 *
 * The obvious fix was to read `draft.provenance` and refuse a write from a capability. It does not
 * work, measured: the LEGITIMATE builder path also writes through `setOnce`
 * (`capability/agent-capabilities.ts:155`), so provenance names a capability either way. What
 * actually differs is where the VALUE came from, and a brand is a value's provenance carried in its
 * type.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * `as never` defeats it, like every brand — and so does ANY REFLECTIVE WRITE: `Object.assign`,
 * `Reflect.set`, `Object.defineProperty`. All three typecheck cast-free, measured, including from
 * inside a `Capability.apply`. That is a TypeScript-wide hole rather than a design choice here —
 * those APIs type their value as `any` or return `T & U` without checking `T`'s existing fields.
 *
 * Stated as a CLASS and not a list, after two rounds of naming one instance and calling it "the one
 * named exception". A list of escapes is a list somebody adds to; the property is that reflection
 * bypasses the type system, and enumerating members of that class understates it every time.
 *
 * TEN other routes are refused, and they are refused by a TEST rather than by this sentence:
 * `tests/type/setting-sources-brand-escapes.test-d.ts` guards each one with a `@ts-expect-error`,
 * so weakening the brand reports which route reopened instead of passing quietly. `setOnce` with a
 * raw array, `setOnce` through a generic wrapper, a direct `draft.settingSources =`, a spread of an
 * array literal, an object literal with `as`, `.concat`, `.map`, spread-widening, `satisfies`,
 * and `.push`.
 *
 * The count said "nine" while the list held ten — the same off-by-one this branch has now made
 * three times in a docblock. Counting them in a file that fails when the count is wrong is the
 * point of moving the claim into a test.
 *
 * So this refuses the accident — a capability author reaching for the field because it is there —
 * with the named exceptions above, and not a caller who has decided to bypass the gate. Naming them
 * exception is the point: the comment this replaced claimed an invariant nothing enforced, and a
 * replacement that overstated its own coverage would be the same defect one size smaller.
 *
 * ## Which roots the SDK actually READS
 *
 * `includesSetting` is called with exactly `"project"` and `"plugins"`
 * (`theokit-sdk/packages/sdk/src/internal/local-agent/local-agent.ts:174-175`). `user`, `team` and
 * `mdm` are accepted by the option and not consulted BY THE SDK, so forwarding them would be a name
 * its runtime discards. `team` and `mdm` are deliberately absent from {@link SettingSourcesSelection}
 * rather than plumbed through to be ignored.
 *
 * **`user` is different now, and the difference is the whole of B-024.** This layer reads the
 * operator's roots itself — `resolveOperatorRoots` in `config/operator-roots.ts` — so `user: true`
 * reaches `~/.theokit/skills/` and `~/.theokit/agents/`, and reaches `~/.claude/` equivalents when
 * the `claude-code` dialect is granted. It is no longer a flag that changes nothing: the SDK still
 * does not consult it, and this layer does.
 *
 * The distinction matters for whoever reads this next. The sentence above was true and complete
 * about the SDK while the FIELD's own docblock described a capability nobody delivered — two
 * docblocks disagreeing about one option, with a consumer reading the reassuring one.

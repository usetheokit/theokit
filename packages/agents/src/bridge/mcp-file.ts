/**
 * M107 T2.1 — the `.mcp.json` project-file loader.
 *
 * The neighbour module `mcp-resolver.ts` decides WHICH servers a request gets; this one READS the
 * `<cwd>/.mcp.json` convention (Claude Code / Cursor) from disk. Splitting them keeps SRP: one
 * decides, the other reads. The layer already shipped the rare cases (per-request resolver, registry
 * builder) and not this, the common one — so every consumer wrote it by hand.
 *
 * Fail-fast (`error-handling.md` § 2): a present-but-malformed `.mcp.json` throws a TYPED, contextual
 * error naming the path rather than silently disabling MCP. An ABSENT file is not an error — it
 * yields an empty map, because MCP is opt-in.
 *
 * **M112 — the `stdio only` scope is over, and degradation is now PER ENTRY.**
 *
 * The previous version of this docblock said: *"remote transports (HTTP/SSE) are deliberately out …
 * widening later is **additive**"*. The reason was good and the exit criterion was written down: be
 * an **exact** substitute for the hand-written loaders. That migration finished in M107; the deadline
 * has passed.
 *
 * **What this module does NOT do, and the finding that shrank M112:** it does not build transports. The SDK
 * already ships `McpServerConfig = McpStdioServerConfig | McpHttpServerConfig`, with `type`/`url`/
 * `headers` (*"Passed through. `Authorization` works here."*), `auth` (OAuth 2.1 PKCE) e
 * `requestTimeoutMs` (`AbortSignal.timeout`, typed error, 30 s default). This file declared a
 * **narrower** `McpServerConfig` and refused what the SDK accepts — two owners of the same fact.
 * M112 stops narrowing; no new dependency was added.
 *
 * **Degradation is per entry, not per file — and that is NOT swallowing an error.** Before, one entry
 * the parser did not understand took down the whole map: a `.mcp.json` with a perfect stdio server
 * and one `type: http` produced `McpFileError`, and the stdio server was lost with it. Fail-closed at
 * the **wrong radius** — refusing *one entry* is correct; refusing *the file* turns "that server is
 * not supported" into "you have no MCP at all". The error is still typed, still names the entry, and
 * is still visible through the `onWarn` channel. An **unparseable** file (broken JSON, an
 * `mcpServers` that is not an object) still throws, because there are no entries to separate there.
 *
 * A failing entry resolves rather than rejects: the failure closes that client, emits a diagnostic
 * naming the server and marks it `DISCONNECTED`, so one server cannot take down the others.
 *
 * **Secrets:** the value of `headers` never enters a warning, and the internal precedent is what
 * decides it: `AuthProvider` states that it never exposes token material, and
 * `.mcp.json` is a **project** file, which can be committed by accident.

 * complaint, and every symptom points at the project file that never mentioned it.
 *
 * It is not implemented HERE because a second location is a precedence decision, not a second
 * `readFileSync`: which file wins per key, whether a user may add a server the project did not
 * declare, and how that interacts with the operator gates in `operator-policy.ts` that already
 * decide which servers may start. `rules/` names precedence as a thing to settle deliberately, and
 * `settings-layers.ts` now has the vocabulary for it — so this belongs in that stack rather than as
 * a private merge rule invented inside a loader.
 *
 * TOOL SEARCH is the other absence, and it is a capability rather than a location: the format lets a
 * model discover tools on demand instead of receiving every server's full tool list up front. This
 * runtime always sends the full list. The consequence is context cost, not incorrectness — which is

/**
 * Builds the entry from an ALLOWLIST of fields, never forwarding the raw object.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and what happened when it did not
 *
 * The first version of M112 returned `entryRaw` directly — it looked harmless, since validation had
 * just passed. It was not. The review measured what crossed:
 *
 * ```
 * {"evil":{"command":"node","args":["evil.js"],"envPolicy":"all","inventedField":{"x":1}}}
 * ```
 *
 * `envPolicy` is NOT just another field. The SDK documents it as: *"drop secret-like host vars
 * (`*KEY*`/`*SECRET*`/`*TOKEN*`/`*PASSWORD*`/`*_AUTH*`) **so a third-party MCP server binary cannot
 * exfiltrate host secrets via the environment**. Pass `"all"` to restore full inheritance."*
 *
 * `.mcp.json` is a PROJECT file, read from `process.cwd()`. Forwarded raw, a repository — including a
 * trusted one, which is the normal case — could hand `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `NPM_TOKEN` and the rest of
 * the environment to a third-party binary with ONE line of JSON. And this layer was the last place
 * that could strip the field.
 *
 * The irony is pointed and worth recording: the same milestone wrote a whole ADR about not leaking
 * the value of a ~40-character header and, in the same diff, opened a channel to the entire
 * environment. Validating is not sanitizing — the allowlist is what separates the two.
 *
 * ## What does NOT get in, and why
 *
 * `envPolicy` is left out DELIBERATELY: it is a host posture decision, and the SDK accepts it from
 * the caller. A file committed to the repository is no place to loosen a process-level defence.
 * Whoever wants full inheritance declares it in the code that builds the agent, where a human
 * reviews it.

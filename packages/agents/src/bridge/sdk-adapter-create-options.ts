 * while the projection that needed it did not follow it.
 *
 * The consequence was measured: `import: ['commands']` forwarded a list containing zero names the

 * `import: []` on the ground that "none" and "unset, so all of them" are both defensible and the
 * difference is whether `<cwd>/.claude/hooks.json` executes — and then this reproduced that exact
 * ambiguity one layer down, in silence.
 *
 * A source whose surfaces all belong to this layer is DROPPED from the SDK's list rather than sent
 * empty: the SDK is asked for what the SDK handles, and if that is nothing it is not asked. The

 * runs, so a test that went through `assembleM8CreateOptions` could not reach it at all." True for
 * one commit, and the reorder that put the narrowing FIRST made it false — while the sentence
 * stayed. That is how the reorder shipped with no test through the path it changed: the docblock
 * said the test was impossible, so nobody wrote it.

/**
 * M84 — `@theokit/agents/client`: the agent's client chain, moved over from the CLI package.
 *
 * ## Why it changed package
 *
 * These nine modules lived in `theokit/client` (the **CLI** package), and nothing inside the CLI
 * depended on them — they were leaves there. What held them was history, not design. The consequence
 * was concrete: a consumer of the layer that wanted an in-process transport had to declare a runtime
 * dependency on the CLI, that is, on a package the `SDK → Theokit → AgentBuilder` boundary forbids it
 * from treating as a layer. agent-builder carried six exemptions written purely to sustain that
 * contradiction.
 *
 * ## Why TWO subpaths, and not the main bar
 *
 * `use-agent.ts` — **one** of the nine — imports React. Putting the chain on the main bar would make
 * every consumer of the layer carry React in its graph, including those that never render anything.
 *
 * And one subpath was not enough: a Node consumer (a transport in a process with no UI) would import
 * the barrel and drag React along. This entry is **React-free** by contract — pinned by
 * `test_client_core_entry_imports_no_react`, a gate that already existed in the CLI and caught the
 * regression on its first run. The hook lives in `@theokit/agents/client/react`.
 *
 * The CLI now re-exports FROM HERE (a pure pass-through): two implementations of the same transport
 * in the same process is exactly what M79 just eliminated.

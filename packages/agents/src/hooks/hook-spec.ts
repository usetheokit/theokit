 * M75 — declarative hooks: from a line in a config file to a bounded, trusted subprocess.
 *
 * ## What the framework published before, and what it did not
 *
 * A well-typed seam (`HookHandlers`, 8 events, `pre_tool_call` as the only veto) — and nothing else.
 * Every step between "the user wrote a command in a config file" and "that command runs, bounded,
 * trusted, and its output comes back safely to the model" belonged to the consumer: 828 lines
 * importing a SINGLE symbol from this package.
 *
 * ## Denial is the default, and it is not a formality
 *
 * This module makes the framework execute ARBITRARY USER COMMANDS. Two gates stand in front of that,
 * and both fail closed:
 *
 * - `trusted` — the directory-level decision from M68/M73. Untrusted directory, no hooks.
 * - `approved` — the per-hook fingerprint set. It is a REQUIRED argument, not an optional one with
 *   a permissive default: an optional gate is a gate somebody forgets, and forgetting this one runs
 *   a stranger's shell command.
 *
 * Approval is keyed by fingerprint precisely so it cannot be inherited by mutation — see
 * `hook-fingerprint.ts`.

   *
   * A real migration found the gap. A consumer arrived with an approval store already on disk,
   * keyed by ITS scheme — a JSON projection with sorted keys and a `sha256:` prefix — while ours
   * joins the fields with U+001E and emits bare hex. Both are sound; they are different, so the same
   * hook hashes to two values.
   *
   * With the function hardcoded, that consumer's `approved` set matched nothing and every hook was
   * refused. Not a crash — a warning per hook and silence afterwards, which is the worst shape a
   * security regression can take.
   *
   * The alternative was a data migration over approval records, and a half-finished one re-prompts
   * an operator for hooks they already approved. Re-prompting for everything is how a user learns to
   * approve reflexively, which is precisely what this gate exists to prevent.
   *
   * What does NOT change: `approved` is still required, an empty set still refuses everything, and
   * the default is still ours. Injecting a function decides how a hook is NAMED, never whether the
   * gate applies.

 * M75 — declarative hooks: from a line in a config file to a bounded, trusted subprocess.
 *
 * ## What the framework published before, and what it did not
 *
 * A well-typed seam (`HookHandlers`, 8 events, `pre_tool_call` as the only veto) — and nothing else.
 * Every step between "the user wrote a command in a config file" and "that command runs, bounded,
 * trusted, and its output comes back safely to the model" belonged to the consumer: 828 lines
 * importing a SINGLE symbol from this package.
 *
 * ## Denial is the default, and it is not a formality
 *
 * This module makes the framework execute ARBITRARY USER COMMANDS. Two gates stand in front of that,
 * and both fail closed:
 *
 * - `trusted` — the directory-level decision from M68/M73. Untrusted directory, no hooks.
 * - `approved` — the per-hook fingerprint set. It is a REQUIRED argument, not an optional one with
 *   a permissive default: an optional gate is a gate somebody forgets, and forgetting this one runs
 *   a stranger's shell command.
 *
 * Approval is keyed by fingerprint precisely so it cannot be inherited by mutation — see
 * `hook-fingerprint.ts`.

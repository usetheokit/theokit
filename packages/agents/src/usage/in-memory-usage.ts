 * M84 — usage in memory.

 * Deliberately does NOT implement `theokit`'s `StorageAdapter`: that is a lifecycle contract of the
 * web framework, and requiring it here is exactly the coupling that made cost tracking unreachable
 * from a terminal product. The `theokit` side extends this one and adds the lifecycle.
 *
 * Concurrency: Node's event loop makes `Array.push` atomic, so concurrent `record()` calls cannot
 * lose data. This is single-process by construction — a multi-instance deploy supplies its own
 * adapter, which is what the interface is for.

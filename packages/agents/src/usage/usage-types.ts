/**
 * M84 — the runtime-neutral half of cost tracking.
 *
 * ## Why it moved
 *
 * 1 715 LOC of observability and cost lived under `packages/theo/src/server/**`, and `theokit` is
 * the Vite/React web framework. The only real product built on this stack depends on
 * `@theokit/agents`, `@theokit/tui` and `@theokit/presenter`, and never on `theokit` — a grep for
 * `from 'theokit` in it returns zero. So none of it was reachable, and what would have been is
 * HTTP-shaped.
 *
 * What crosses is the vocabulary and the in-memory adapter: a record, a query, a result, and a place
 * to put them. The HTTP wiring (`trackAgentRun`, spans named `http.request`, keying by `requestId`)
 * stays in `theokit`, because that is what it is about.
 *
 * ## `userId` is optional here, and that is the point
 *
 * The HTTP path always has one. A terminal agent has no user — it has a person at a keyboard — and
 * requiring the field forced every terminal product to invent a constant. An invented identifier is
 * worse than an absent one: it looks like data.

// `createDelegateTool` — the one agent-facing capability the framework was missing.
//
// Measured (`discoveries/blueprints/theocode-baseline-gaps-blueprint.md`): `@theokit/agents/tools`
// ships 23 factories the agent can call mid-run, and `@theokit/agents` ships `delegate()`,
// `delegateWithScoring()`, `delegateBackground()` and `Squad` for the APP to call. Local sub-agent
// delegation was the single capability present on one side and absent on the other — the framework
// could delegate, and the agent had no way to ask it to. `createA2ATool` is not the counterpart:
// its target is a REMOTE peer over a network transport, with none of the parent's tools, budget or
// authority carried across.
//
// It cannot live beside the other 23. Those are `@theokit/sdk-tools`, and `delegate()` is
// framework-owned — an SDK-side factory would have the SDK importing the framework, inverting G1's
// dependency direction. It is re-exported through the same `./tools` subpath so the consumer sees
// one surface regardless of which side of the seam a factory is implemented on.
//
// THIN BY DESIGN (parsimony rung 6). `delegate()` already merges the parent's tools, clamps the
// budget and propagates authority. Re-deriving any of that here would put two owners on one rule,
// which is how the two copies diverge in silence (G12).

 * What the model is told about a refusal.
 *
 * A budget or a timeout is a fact about the WORK, and its message is what the model acts on. A
 * guardrail message is not: it reads `Guardrail "pii-detector" blocked output: ssn found`, naming
 * the guard and the exact trigger. Give that to a model and it has a map around the gate — it
 * learns which words to avoid, not that it should stop. It still learns it was refused, which is
 * the one bit it can act on: delegate less, or do the work itself.
 *
 * ## The default is WITHHOLD, and the first version had it backwards
 *
 * This began as `if (code === 'guardrail_violation') return fixed` — a denylist, so any code added
 * to {@link errorCodeOf} later would pass its typed message through by DEFAULT, silently, on the
 * one function whose entire purpose is withholding. `errorCodeOf` directly above is an allowlist
 * (unknown → `undefined` → rethrow); this is now one too, and the two read the same way.
 *
 * Adding a code to `errorCodeOf` and not to `MESSAGE_MAY_CROSS` makes it withhold. That is the safe
 * direction of forgetting, and it is the only one a reviewer can rely on.
 *
 * ## The hole this used to name, and what closed it
 *
 * `DelegationError`'s message is `Delegation to agent "X" failed: ${cause.message}`
 * (`delegation-types.ts`), and `run-reflective-loop.ts` wrapped a non-delegation round error into
 * one — so a guard throwing INSIDE a round crossed as `delegation_failed`, which IS on the
 * allowlist above, with the guard's name and trigger intact. Measured through this tool with a
 * consumer-supplied `streamFactory`.
 *
 * `run-reflective-loop.ts` now lets `GuardrailViolationError` pass through as itself, alongside the
 * two delegation errors that already did, so it reaches `errorCodeOf` as the class it is. This
 * section described the hole as open for one round after the commit that closed it, in a file that
 * commit did not touch.

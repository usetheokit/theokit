/**
 * The `@theokit/agents/config` subpath — agent configuration, trust, and the instruction tree.
 *
 * ## Why these modules live here and not in `theokit`
 *
 * They used to be reachable only through `theokit/server`, a barrel that announces its own removal
 * on first import. That is worse than an absent capability: a builder finds it, reads that it is
 * going away, and writes their own anyway. And the package holding it is the WEB framework — an
 * agent builder installs `@theokit/agents` and may never install `theokit` at all. The only real
 * consumer of this layer has four packages and none of them depends on `theokit`.
 *
 * The cost of that was measured, not hypothesised. Because `loadInstructionTree` was unreachable,
 * a downstream product rewrote 533 lines of instruction-tree loading — and in rewriting it
 * reintroduced the symlink-containment hole that `assertNoSymlinkEscape` exists to close: with
 * `rootDir='/'`, any file on the machine became readable into the system prompt.
 *
 * Absorbing a consumer's module means absorbing its scar tissue, not just its interface. Keeping
 * these behind a deprecated door in the wrong package meant nobody inherited either.
 *
 * ## Direction
 *
 * `theokit` depends on `@theokit/agents`, never the reverse (G1). Moving the modules DOWN preserves
 * that: `theokit/server` now re-exports from here, so its consumers keep working for the one minor
 * cycle it promised, and new consumers import from the package they already have.

/**
 * M79 — "given an env, a home and a model, WHICH credential do I use, and WHERE did it come from?"
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * The genuinely hard half was already supplied: RFC 8628 device flow, refresh under a cross-process
 * lock, persistence, account-id extraction. The half every consumer meets FIRST was answered twice
 * inside the framework and exposed neither time — `resolveProvider()` locked behind
 * `internal-api.ts`, and `resolveCredential` deliberately withheld from `@theokit/agents/auth`.
 *
 * The "app policy" framing defends **which** providers exist. It does not defend the precedence
 * chain, the prefix↔provider consistency check, or the provenance record: those are mechanism. A
 * consumer forced to rewrite mechanism wrote a 70-line dotenv parser for the single question "shell
 * or `.env`?".
 *
 * ## Why the descriptors are a PARAMETER, and why this name is safe here
 *
 * Two functions already share the name `resolveCredential` with divergent semantics — sync vs async,
 * throws vs `undefined`, reads env vs does not, infers the provider vs refuses — which is exactly
 * why `auth-entry.ts` withholds the SDK's. A third under the same name in the same scope would
 * invite importing the wrong one.
 *
 * Taking the descriptor list as an ARGUMENT is what makes this one distinguishable at the call site
 * rather than by luck: it is the only one whose signature says which providers it is talking about.
 * The SDK's symbol stays unexported from this subpath, so only one is reachable.

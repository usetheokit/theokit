/**
 * M60 — `AuthProvider`, the OO contract that unifies the SDK's free OAuth-lifecycle functions
 * (`openaiDeviceLogin` → `persistOAuthTokens` → `ensureFreshCredential`). Those are stateful across a
 * SHARED `config` (`OAuthProviderConfig`) + `store` (`CredentialStoreConfig`); this class holds that
 * state so a consumer authors `new AuthProvider(config, store).persist(...)` / `.ensureFresh(...)`
 * instead of threading `config`/`store` through every call — the `SDK → Theokit → AgentBuilder`
 * boundary applied to the auth domain (ENRICH, per blueprint D2: auth carries orchestration + state).
 *
 * It DELEGATES, never reimplements (parsimony Rung 9): each method forwards verbatim to the SDK
 * function, so login → persist → refresh produces byte-identical state to calling the SDK directly.
 *
 * SECRET-SAFETY (hard rule): this class NEVER logs, stringifies, or otherwise surfaces token material.
 * Methods return exactly what the SDK returns and add no observability — a token is data that flows
 * through, never something this layer emits. The parity/secret tests pin both properties.

/**
 * Persisted tool-permission grants — "always allow this", without "allow everything".
 *
 * ## Why this is the one genuine absorption in its plan
 *
 * Measured by grep across both packages: `alwaysAllow|allowRule|permissionRule|rememberDecision`
 * returns **zero**. `ApprovalDecision` settles ONE request; nothing persists a standing grant.
 * Neither the framework nor its closest consumer had this for tools — the consumer built the
 * equivalent for HOOKS only, and for tools its single escape is the global `full-auto`, which
 * removes the gate rather than narrowing it.
 *
 * So the honest state of the art was: approve the same `npm test` a tenth time, or turn the gate
 * off. The tenth prompt is where a person stops reading prompts, which makes the "safe" option the
 * one that produces unsafe behaviour.
 *
 * ## The key IS the safety property
 *
 * A grant is keyed by **(tool, scope, signature)**:
 *
 * - **tool** — "always allow `run_shell`" must not authorise `apply_patch`.
 * - **scope** — canonicalised with `realpath`. `/repo/a`, `/repo/a/` and `/repo/./a` are one
 *   directory and three strings; a symlink is a fourth. String equality both denies grants the user
 *   made (training them toward `full-auto`) and lets a link borrow a grant made for somewhere else.
 *   The consumer's own trust store had exactly this defect, measured.
 * - **signature** — the command, whitespace-normalised and NEVER fuzzy-matched. `npm test` does not
 *   authorise `npm test --force`. A near-match that grants is worse than no grant, because the user
 *   believes they approved something narrower than what runs.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Deny by default, always. An absent store, an unreadable one, a corrupt one, an unresolvable scope
 * and an expired grant all answer `false`. A corrupt store additionally REPORTS
 * (`lastReadError`) — reading as empty is indistinguishable from being empty, and the operator
 * would never learn their grants stopped applying.

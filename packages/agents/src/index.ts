//
// `@theokit/sdk/errors` and `./bridge/index.js` both exported `BudgetExceededError`, and they were
// NOT the same thing: the SDK's is a per-WINDOW budget (`budgetName`, `window`, `spentUsd`, `mode`);
// the layer's is a per-DELEGATION budget (`agentName`, `actualCost`, `budgetLimit`). Since the
// consumer holds an unbreakable rule never to import `@theokit/sdk` directly, it never reached the
// SDK's — and an `instanceof` silently matched the wrong domain.
//
// ## What `4.26.0` got wrong, measured
//
// It **reused** the name: the barrel started exporting the SDK class as `BudgetExceededError`. For
// a consumer on `^4.25` doing `catch (e) { if (e instanceof BudgetExceededError) … }`, the
// delegation-budget branch **stopped matching, silently** — exactly the failure mode this milestone
// exists to kill, mirrored. And it shipped as a MINOR.
//
// ## The fix
//
// The old name goes back to being the DELEGATION class — the `@deprecated` alias the DoD asked for,
// the same referential identity as always, zero breakage for anyone on `^4.25`. The SDK class
// crosses under a name that does not collide, closing the original gap without reusing anybody's
// name: "enriching never reduces" (M73) also means not redefining what a name means.

//
// ## Why they were missing, and why that is not the story it looks like
//
// M63 declared this boundary closed. It was not — and the cause was NOT a forgotten line here. Seven
// of these eight symbols DID NOT EXIST in the `@theokit/sdk` this package depended on. Measured by
// downloading every published tarball and grepping `dist/`: 4.40.0 → 0/7, 4.45.0 → 1/7, 4.46.0 → 3/7,
// 4.47.0 → 4/7, 4.48.0 → 6/7, 4.49.0 → 7/7. The floor moved to `^4.49.0` (ADR 0060) so that this
// block could be written at all.
//
// ## The evidence that they were wanted
//
// The consumer holds "never import `@theokit/sdk` directly" as an unbreakable rule, and broke it SIX
// times in production to reach exactly this family: `config/layers.ts:10` (foldLayers,
// verifyLayerOrdering), `config/config.ts:1` (auditEnvReachability), `config/trust-posture.ts:8-11`
// (resolveTrustPosture), `config/security-floor.ts:22` (applySecurityFloor),
// `wired-capabilities.ts:22` (recordWiring, WiredEntity), `tools/view-image.ts:15`
// (ToolResultContentBlock). A team breaking its own rule rather than reimplementing is the strongest
// signal available that the door, not the appetite, was what was missing.
//
// ## Named list, never `export *`
//
// `export *` is used above for five small cohesive subpaths (`/errors`, `/retry`, …) where "part of
// the domain" is not a meaningful unit. This is NOT a subpath: it is a slice of the SDK's root bar,
// and starring it would drag the SDK's entire surface into this barrel and erase the boundary M63
// drew. `tests/unit/subpath-coverage.test.ts` now demands a verdict for every root-bar VALUE, so the
// next addition upstream breaks the build ONCE instead of disappearing for nine minors (ADR 0061).

// `grep -c <name> dist/errors.d.ts` returns 0.

// could call our `verifyLayerOrdering` and be unable to `catch` its declared error by type without
// importing `@theokit/sdk` directly: the precise rule-break this milestone exists to remove,
// reintroduced by the milestone itself.
//

// exactly the defect this milestone closes". The first version of the root-bar verdict table filed
// all five under "internal helper with no consumer-facing contract", which the `.d.ts` contradicts
// word for word. Caught by the `/review` gate; the table now says `in` and the export makes it true.

/**
 * M9 — apply output guards to a stream (ADR-0040 § D2).
 *
 * Generic over the event type (no dependency on the bridge's `StreamEvent` — keeps this module
 * pure per G1). When any guard defines `checkOutput`, the stream is BUFFERED: every event is held,
 * the accumulated text is moderated, and only on pass are the events replayed. A `block` throws
 * {@link GuardrailViolationError} BEFORE any event reaches the client — the honest "blocked before
 * reaching the client" semantics. Streaming is traded for safety only when an output guard exists;
 * with none, this is a transparent pass-through (streaming preserved).

 * is exactly the kind of no-op this project refuses to ship.
 *
 * ## This is RUN-STATE checkpointing. It is not file undo, and the name is shared (B-059)
 *
 * What this saves is the conversation: enough to RESUME a run. It does not snapshot the files an
 * agent edited and cannot restore one.
 *
 * The distinction is written here because the word is the whole problem. Measured 2026-09-11:
 * `rewindFiles`, `rewind_files`, `restoreFile` and `backup` return 0 files in this package, 0 in the
 * SDK's `.d.ts` and 0 in `@theokit/sdk-tools`, while `checkpoint` returns six — all of them this
 * subject. **Any parity checklist that greps for `checkpoint` is satisfied by the wrong one**, and
 * reports a capability that does not exist.
 *
 * So a consumer building an interactive coding agent implements snapshot and restore themselves.
 * There is no pre-write seam on the edit tools to hang it on either, which is the part that makes it
 * a feature rather than a wiring job — and the reason it is stated here instead of half-built.
 *
 * Pinned by `tests/unit/run-state-checkpointing-is-not-file-undo.test.ts`, which goes red if a file

 *
 * **What it populates IS projected into `Agent.create`.** `assembleM8CreateOptions` forwards

 * spawns one.
 *
 * That was not true until B-034. `M8CreateOptions` had no `agents` field, `agent-compiler.ts`
 * recorded the gap as ADR D3 — "a resolver here is carried, not invoked" — and declaring a sub-agent
 * through this capability compiled cleanly and spawned nothing, while the class crossed the public
 * barrel alongside `SubagentDefinition`, `discoverSubagents`, `loadSubagentDefinition` and
 * `listSubagentNames`. A consumer read the barrel, assembled the authoring chain and met silence:
 * the "the type crossed, the capability did not" shape `bridge/index.ts` names four times by issue
 * number. The deferral was a decision; the consumer discovering it at runtime was not.
 *
 * The children are SDK `AgentDefinition`s (`SubagentDefinition` on the barrel), the same shape the
 * per-run door `RuntimeOverrides.agents` always took. A per-run value still WINS over this one —

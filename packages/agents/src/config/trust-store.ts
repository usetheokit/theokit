/**
 * M73 — the per-directory trust store: a trust decision that survives the process.
 *
 * ## Why persisting it matters
 *
 * M68 made `settingSources`' `project` root require a `TrustPosture` — evidence, not a claim. But a
 * posture computed fresh on every run is a question asked over and over, and a question asked every
 * run is a question users learn to answer without reading.
 *
 * Persisting turns the stamp into a DECISION: recorded once, auditable afterwards, and answerable by
 * "who trusted this directory, when, and on what basis" rather than by re-deriving it.
 *
 * ## Why the file permission is checked on READ
 *
 * This file decides whether a directory may run shell hooks. A store any other user can write is a
 * store any other user can use to grant themselves that. Checking at write time only would leave a
 * file whose mode was loosened afterwards looking fine — so the check is where the value is
 * consumed, and a loose mode is REFUSED rather than repaired: silently tightening it hides that
 * something changed the mode, which is the fact worth knowing.

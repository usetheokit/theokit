/**
 * M74 — load a tree of project instruction files, with explicit ceilings.
 *
 * ## Why `compileProjectContext` does not cover this
 *
 * It reads ONE fixed file through the SDK: no depth or file budget, no frontmatter, no cycle guard,
 * no truncation policy, no warning channel. A product that wants project-scoped instructions writes
 * roughly 720 lines of mechanism — all of it identical between products, none of it about their
 * domain.
 *
 * ## The containment check is a security control
 *
 * A symlink inside a project directory can point anywhere. Following one lets a repository the user
 * just cloned inject the contents of `~/.ssh/config`, or any other readable file, straight into the
 * model's system prompt. That is prompt injection with the filesystem as the vector, and every
 * consumer that writes this loader by hand reintroduces it.
 *
 * `assertNoSymlinkEscape` is the SDK's, crossed in M67. Composing it is what makes the check the
 * same one everywhere instead of four subtly different `realpath` comparisons.
 *
 * ## Failure is per FILE, not per tree
 *
 * A malformed frontmatter skips that file and warns. Failing the whole load would let one bad file
 * in a deep tree silently disable every instruction the user wrote — the loudest possible failure
 * producing the quietest possible outcome.

 * supported: a pattern using them matches literally and therefore almost certainly not at all.
 *
 * That is a deliberate floor rather than a step toward a glob library. Three wildcards are a dozen
 * lines; a dependency for them carries a transitive tree into a package whose direct dependencies
 * number three. If a caller needs the fuller grammar, that is a decision to make out loud — adding

 * returned **0 files** across every package source tree, against a control of 4 for `AGENTS.md`;
 * query over the newly-resolved `@theokit/sdk@5.5.0` returned **0** against a control of 23 for

 * if the operator had written nothing.

 *
 * A local file never REPLACES its public sibling; both load. The trap the reference implementation
 * names is what this avoids: with one chain, adding a `THEO.md` would silently orphan an existing
 * `AGENTS.local.md` — a file the operator wrote, disabled by a file they added for an unrelated
 * reason. Here it costs nothing to avoid, because this walk has no winner-takes-all at all: it
 * accepts every matching entry rather than taking the first name that exists.
 *
 * ## Why `CLAUDE.local.md` is NOT here
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` is not in the public half of this list either. A private companion to a file this seam
 * does not read would pair with nothing, and adding it would quietly widen what this default covers
 * under the guise of symmetry. If `CLAUDE.md` is ever added here, its companion comes with it.

/**
 * M74 — load a tree of project instruction files, with explicit ceilings.
 *
 * ## Why `compileProjectContext` does not cover this
 *
 * It reads ONE fixed file through the SDK: no depth or file budget, no frontmatter, no cycle guard,
 * no truncation policy, no warning channel. A product that wants project-scoped instructions writes
 * roughly 720 lines of mechanism — all of it identical between products, none of it about their
 * domain.
 *
 * ## The containment check is a security control
 *
 * A symlink inside a project directory can point anywhere. Following one lets a repository the user
 * just cloned inject the contents of `~/.ssh/config`, or any other readable file, straight into the
 * model's system prompt. That is prompt injection with the filesystem as the vector, and every
 * consumer that writes this loader by hand reintroduces it.
 *
 * `assertNoSymlinkEscape` is the SDK's, crossed in M67. Composing it is what makes the check the
 * same one everywhere instead of four subtly different `realpath` comparisons.
 *
 * ## Failure is per FILE, not per tree
 *
 * A malformed frontmatter skips that file and warns. Failing the whole load would let one bad file
 * in a deep tree silently disable every instruction the user wrote — the loudest possible failure
 * producing the quietest possible outcome.

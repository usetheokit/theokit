/**
 * B-028 — `.claude/agent-memory/`, the per-subagent memory a `memory:` frontmatter key promises.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-12 with controls (`loadMcpJson` 6 files here, an invented term 0): `agent-memory`
 * returns 0 files in this package, and the 7 hits in `@theokit/sdk@5.5.0` — the version the
 * downstream product runs — are the internal module names `local-agent-memory.ts`,
 * `local-agent-memory-direct.ts` and `local-agent-memory-provider.ts`. The SDK's `MemorySettings` is
 * a different feature: a vector store with embeddings and `scope: "agent" | "user" | "team"`.
 *
 * So a subagent whose frontmatter said `memory: project` began every run with nothing while its own
 * definition said otherwise.
 *
 * ## What this module owns
 *
 * It RESOLVES the root for a scope and READS `MEMORY.md` under the documented caps. Writing is the
 * subagent's, and composing the text into a system prompt belongs to whoever builds the prompt —
 * inventing a second composition path here would give one failure two vocabularies, the same reason
 * `output-styles.ts` stops at reading.
 *
 * ## Why an unknown scope THROWS
 *
 * The three roots differ in who can see the notes: `project` is committed and shared with the team,
 * `local` is deliberately kept out of version control, `user` crosses projects. Falling back to
 * `project` on an unrecognised value would publish, on the next commit, notes somebody wrote
 * expecting privacy. There is no safe default among three answers that differ in exactly that way.

/**
 * A subagent definition with its declared memory appended to the prompt it will receive.
 *
 * `@theokit/sdk` carries `memory:` on the definition and stops there, deliberately: which of three
 * roots a note lives under is a decision about who can see it, and a second copy of that rule in
 * that package is how the two drift into disagreeing about privacy. {@link resolveAgentMemory} owns
 * it here — and until this function existed, it owned it with no caller. The reader and the
 * declaration were one call apart for as long as both existed, which is the capability-with-no-route
 * shape this repository keeps finding.
 *
 * The reference implementation loads a subagent's `MEMORY.md` into its system prompt. A subagent's
 * prompt here is `definition.prompt`, so that is where the notes go.
 *
 * Three things it refuses to do quietly:
 *
 *   - **An unrecognised scope throws**, because {@link resolveAgentMemory} throws, and softening
 *     that into a no-op would publish on the next commit something written expecting privacy.
 *   - **No notes means no change.** An agent that declares `memory:` before writing its first note
 *     is an ordinary first run, not a misconfiguration.
 *   - **The notes are marked as notes.** Appending them bare would hand the model somebody's
 *     scratchpad as though it were instruction.
 *
 * The input is never mutated: a caller mapping over a loaded record should not find the record
 * changed underneath it.

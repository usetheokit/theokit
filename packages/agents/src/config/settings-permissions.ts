/**
 * Translate a settings `permissions` block into rules the SDK's engine evaluates.
 *
 * The SDK ships `PermissionEngine(rules, { defaultAction })` and it is a CODE surface: you construct
 * it with `PermissionRule[]`. What was missing was the path from the FILE to those rules. Measured
 * 2026-09-11: `permissions` appears in 13 SDK files, and the SDK reads `settings.json` in three, of
 * which two are sourcemaps and the third describes the hooks shape. An operator writing
 * `{ "permissions": { "deny": ["Bash(curl:*)"] } }` got a file nothing translated.
 *
 * ## Partial fidelity would be worse than absence
 *
 * A `deny` that silently fails to match is a control the operator believes is in force — strictly
 * more dangerous than no rule, because without one they would have written the guard themselves. So
 * every entry this module cannot render faithfully is RETURNED as unsupported, with a reason, and
 * excluded from the rules. Nothing is quietly turned into a matcher that does not bite.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not attempt
 *
 * The reference's specifier language is larger than this: path globs with `~` expansion, per-tool
 * argument names, and matching semantics that differ by tool. Implementing a lookalike would produce
 * rules that match *almost* the right calls, which is the failure above. Two forms are translated —
 * a bare tool name, and `Tool(prefix:*)` / `Tool(exact)` — and everything else is reported.

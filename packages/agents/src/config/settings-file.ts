/**
 * Read the settings files the declared layers correspond to.
 *
 * `settings-layers.ts` publishes the precedence stack and opens no file. Measured 2026-09-11 with
 * controls (`loadMcpJson` 5 files, an invented term 0): `settings.local.json` appeared once in this
 * package, as a COMMENT; `outputStyle` appeared zero times in either this package or the SDK's built
 * output. Three parity features were unreachable for one shared reason — nothing read values out of
 * a settings file.
 *
 * ## What this adds, and what it deliberately reuses
 *
 * It opens the three files that correspond to real layers and hands them to {@link LayeredConfig},
 * which already folds, verifies ordering and reports provenance. Re-deriving the fold here would
 * give two answers to "which layer wins" — the defect that module exists to remove.
 *
 * `command-line` and `managed` are absent on purpose. The first is not a file; the second is the
 * operator policy, which `operator-policy.ts` reads from a platform-owned path with its own refusal
 * semantics. Reading it twice, in two vocabularies, is how two answers to one question start.
 *
 * ## Unknown keys survive
 *
 * The brief is the same MECHANISMS, not every configuration, so the schema passes unrecognised keys
 * through untouched. A reader that dropped what it did not recognise would silently discard an
 * operator's configuration — the failure this batch of work is about, committed by the module
 * written to close it.

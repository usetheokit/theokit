  /**
   * ## Raised from 35_000 to 36_500 in M80 — measured, not convenient
   *
   * Reparenting eleven error classes onto `TheokitAgentError` cost **751 bytes**, measured by
   * building the barrel with and without the change (34 732 → 35 483). Those bytes are the
   * `code` and `isRetryable` literals: they ARE the milestone, and removing them would undo the
   * fix — the classes go back to being invisible to `isTransientError`, and the consumer goes back
   * to a regex over an eight-level `cause` chain.
   *
   * The alternative considered and rejected: move `capability/` out of the main barrel to make room.
   * It sits there by a decision recorded in M56, and shuffling an unrelated module to fit a ceiling
   * would be paying for this change with someone else's design.
   *
   * The ceiling was 36 500 — the measured 35 483 plus about a kilobyte of headroom, stated so the
   * next milestone that adds barrel surface still meets a guard rather than a formality.
   *
   * ## Raised again to 37 500 for #390 — measured the same way
   *
   * Masking a failure's text before it reaches a browser cost **215 bytes**, attributed by building
   * the barrel with and without the change (36 285 → 36 500), which is exactly ON the old ceiling
   * and therefore failing. The bytes are the `MaskError` type's default and the hook threaded to
   * both entry points; removing them restores a wire that publishes a driver's own words to a
   * browser, which is the defect.
   *
   * Attributed rather than assumed: the same measurement showed #386 — routing the second SSE
   * encoder through the shared translator — cost **zero**, because the translator was already
   * reachable from this barrel through `streamAgentUIMessages`. It would have been easy to blame
   * the larger-looking change.
   *
   * The alternative considered and rejected: shrink by dropping the in-process entry's copy of the
   * option. That is the half the parity gate had just refused, and paying for a security default
   * with a transport-dependent one is not a saving.
   *
   * ## Raised again to 38 500 for B-004 — measured the same way
   *
   * Carrying `CompatImportUnsupportedError` across the barrel cost **64 bytes**, attributed by
   * building with and without only that export line: 37 484 → 37 548. The old ceiling of 37 500 had
   * sixteen bytes of headroom, so any public type crossing the barrel was going to trip it.
   *
   * The bytes buy a consumer the ability to `catch (e) { if (e instanceof CompatImportUnsupportedError) }`
   * instead of matching a message string. The refusal shipped one commit WITHOUT crossing the
   * barrel, while the class it was written to mirror sat beside it — the fifth instance of that
   * shape (#663, #668, #675, #686), and `the-gate-is-nameable-by-a-consumer.test.ts` exists to catch
   * exactly it. Paying 64 bytes to keep that guard honest is the cheaper side of the trade.
   *
   * Headroom is again about a kilobyte, and again stated so the next barrel addition meets a guard
   * rather than a formality.
   *
   * ## Raised again to 39 500 for B-002 — measured the same way
   *
   * Carrying `withPreCompaction` and its types across the barrel cost **160 bytes**, attributed by
   * building with and without only that export line: 38 368 → 38 528.
   *
   * Two things worth the next reader's time. The 160 bytes buy the pre-compaction seam a consumer
   * can reach from the package entry — FR-003 measures reachability through the public export map,
   * so a module that exists and is not exported satisfies nothing. And the gate was already at 38 368
   * BEFORE this change: the 14.0.0 work had left 132 bytes of the last kilobyte, so this addition met
   * a ceiling that was nearly spent rather than one it alone exhausted.
   *
   * Headroom is about a kilobyte again. Anyone who finds themselves raising it a fourth time inside
   * one release cycle should read that as the barrel growing faster than the budget was written for,
   * not as the number being wrong.
   *
   * ## NOT raised a fourth time for B-024 — the warning above was the right one
   *
   * `resolveOperatorRoots` went into the root barrel first and this gate caught it: 41 416 against
   * the 39 500 ceiling, attributed by control at **2 888 bytes** for that one module (38 528
   * without, 41 416 with). The paragraph above had already named the reading — the barrel growing
   * faster than the budget was written for — and the fix was the SHAPE, not the number.
   *
   * It moved to the `./config` subpath, where this package's README says it belongs: *"Twenty entry
   * points. Import the one you need — the barrel is not the API."* `./config` already carries agent
   * configuration and the operator policy, so the reader of the operator's ROOTS now sits beside
   * the reader of the operator's POLICY rather than in a barrel every consumer pays for.
   *
   * The root bundle is 38 528 again — the same number as before B-024 — so the capability costs a
   * consumer who does not import it exactly nothing. The ceiling comes DOWN to 38 600, restoring
   * the tightness the 39 500 raise had spent: a gate carrying a kilobyte of slack is a gate that
   * approves the next kilobyte without being asked.
   *
   * There is deliberately no size gate on `./config` itself. The root barrel is what every consumer
   * pays for unconditionally; a subpath is opt-in, and a gate on every entry point would be a
   * budget nobody set against a cost nobody bears.

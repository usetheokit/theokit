  /**
   * ## Raised from 35_000 to 36_500 in M80 — measured, not convenient
   *
   * Reparenting eleven error classes onto `TheokitAgentError` cost **751 bytes**, measured by
   * building the barrel with and without the change (34 732 → 35 483). Those bytes are the
   * `code` and `isRetryable` literals: they ARE the milestone, and removing them would undo the
   * fix — the classes go back to being invisible to `isTransientError`, and the consumer goes back
   * to a regex over an eight-level `cause` chain.
   *
   * The alternative considered and rejected: move `capability/` out of the main barrel to make room.
   * It sits there by a decision recorded in M56, and shuffling an unrelated module to fit a ceiling
   * would be paying for this change with someone else's design.
   *
   * The ceiling was 36 500 — the measured 35 483 plus about a kilobyte of headroom, stated so the
   * next milestone that adds barrel surface still meets a guard rather than a formality.
   *
   * ## Raised again to 37 500 for #390 — measured the same way
   *
   * Masking a failure's text before it reaches a browser cost **215 bytes**, attributed by building
   * the barrel with and without the change (36 285 → 36 500), which is exactly ON the old ceiling
   * and therefore failing. The bytes are the `MaskError` type's default and the hook threaded to
   * both entry points; removing them restores a wire that publishes a driver's own words to a
   * browser, which is the defect.
   *
   * Attributed rather than assumed: the same measurement showed #386 — routing the second SSE
   * encoder through the shared translator — cost **zero**, because the translator was already
   * reachable from this barrel through `streamAgentUIMessages`. It would have been easy to blame
   * the larger-looking change.
   *
   * The alternative considered and rejected: shrink by dropping the in-process entry's copy of the
   * option. That is the half the parity gate had just refused, and paying for a security default
   * with a transport-dependent one is not a saving.

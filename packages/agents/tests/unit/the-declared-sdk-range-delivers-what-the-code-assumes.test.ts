/**
 * The declared range promised a floor that delivered none of the parity it advertises.
 *
 * `packages/agents` declared `"@theokit/sdk": "^4.52.1 || ^5.0.0"`. Measured 2026-09-12 by
 * unpacking the published tarballs, against a control of `AgentOptions` (83-86 files in every one):
 *
 * | surface                 | 4.52.1 | 5.0.0 | 5.3.0 | 5.4.0 |
 * |-------------------------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
 * | `CompatSurface`         | 0      | 10    | 10    | 10    |
 * | `.claude/rules/*` spec  | 0      | 4     | 4     | 4     |
 * | `settings.local.json`   | 0      | 4     | 4     | 4     |
 * | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`    | 0      | 14    | 14    | 14    |
 *
 * So the boundary is the 4→5 major exactly, and the lower half of the declared range delivered ZERO
 * parity. Not one missing surface: every surface at once, invisibly, because the package resolves,
 * compiles and runs. This repository's own lockfile resolved 4.52.1, so its 1887 green tests were
 * green against an SDK where `compatSources` does not exist as an option.
 *
 * ## Why the range was narrowed rather than guarded with a fourth runtime check
 *
 * Three version guards already exist — `HOOK_GATE_SINCE`, `COMPAT_IMPORT_SINCE`, and the
 * `compatSources` warning — and each one is on a path where this layer PASSES AN OPTION to the SDK.
 * The three surfaces above are not like that: nothing is passed, the SDK simply reads a file or does
 * not, so there is no call site to guard. A fourth check could not have been written.
 *
 * The reason the floor stayed low is recorded in `sdk-adapter-create-options.ts` and has expired:
 * *"Until this package's floor can name a stable 5.x"*. `@theokit/sdk@5.5.0` is published and is
 * `latest`; stable 5.x has existed since 5.3.0.
 *
 * ## The invariant this file pins
 *
 * **Every version inside the declared range either works, or fails with a typed error naming what it
 * needs. None fails in silence.** That is the whole distinction between the two kinds of gap:
 *
 * - below 5.0.0 the surfaces are simply absent and nothing says so → closed by the RANGE
 * - between 5.0.0 and 5.4.0 `local.hooks` and the narrowed `import` are absent → guarded by
 *   `HookGateUnsupportedError` and `CompatImportUnsupportedError`, which name the version
 * - below 5.11.0 the SDK sends no cache directive for an Anthropic-family model, so every turn pays
 *   full price for the system prompt, and nothing says so → closed by the RANGE, which is why the
 *   floor is now the caching release (B-412). The two guards above are unreachable from inside
 *   that range unless an override pins the SDK lower; their removal is B-488.
 *
 * A test that only asserted the string would pass on a range someone widened back by hand with a
 * different spelling, so the floor is PARSED and compared numerically.

/**
 * M90 T0.1/T1.1 — the surface of the five infra subpaths is a contract, not a side effect.
 *
 * ## The defect this file closes
 *
 * Until M90, the whole of `tools-entry.ts` was `export * from '@theokit/sdk-tools'`, and the emitted
 * `dist/tools.d.ts` had **one line** saying the same thing. The layer lent its name without
 * interposing a decision: an upstream rename propagated verbatim, **with no build error here**, and
 * the consumer found out at a call site. The consumer's boundary gate pins the *specifier string*,
 * not the type surface, so it did not see it either.
 *
 * ## Why the snapshot reads `dist`, and not `src`
 *
 * The `.d.ts` is the artifact the consumer actually sees. A snapshot over the source would prove we
 * wrote the list, not that it reached the package — the same distinction agent-builder's M89 paid
 * dearly to learn, when a gate proved somebody had written the root into a list, and not that the
 * files were in the compiler's program.
 *
 * ## Why it reuses `enumerateSurface` instead of reimplementing
 *
 * Two lists that must stay in sync are a DRY violation with a false claim on top — it is the text of
 * `subpath-coverage.test.ts` itself (M78's F-10 review), which lost `bench` from a copy while the
 * comment swore "same scope".

   * its return type `SessionArtifact`; `/sandbox` gained `writableRootsFor`. All four now cross.
   * `classifySessionArtifact` is worth naming — the roadmap's M72 was about to re-implement it under
   * another name, and crossing it here is what makes that unnecessary.
   *
   * Not redundant with the identity gate below: that one compares the snapshot against the LAYER, so
   * a regeneration that produced an empty file from a broken layer would pass on both sides. This one
   * fails a snapshot that shrank, whatever the cause.

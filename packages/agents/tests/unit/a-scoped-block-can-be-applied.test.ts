/**
 * `scopes` was published and nothing could apply it.
 *
 * `InstructionBlock.scopes` carries the `paths:` frontmatter, and the field's own docblock names the
 * consequence of getting it wrong: "A consumer rendering the block would then apply a rule written
 * for one subtree EVERYWHERE — the one frontmatter failure with a consequence, and a silent one."
 * It then hands the decision to the product: "Products with a fail-closed policy drop the block on
 * this flag instead of publishing it unscoped."
 *
 * Delegating the DECISION is deliberate and stays that way. What was missing is the means: there was
 * no glob matcher anywhere in the package, so a consumer who wanted to honour the scope had to
 * invent the semantics — and two consumers would invent two.
 *
 * Deliberately small: `**`, `*` and `?`, matching what the SDK's own rule activation supports.
 * Brace expansion and character classes are NOT supported, and a caller needing them should say so
 * rather than discover it — hence the explicit case at the bottom.

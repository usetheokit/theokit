/**
 * B-014 — an output guard never saw the model's reasoning.
 *
 * `agent-runner.ts` handed `moderateOutputStream` an `extractText` matching `text_delta` and nothing
 * else, while `thinking` is a public `AgentStreamEvent` that reaches the client like any other.
 * Measured before this: a guard declared over the agent's output, and
 * `thinking "the key is sk-abc123"` delivered verbatim.
 *
 * The third channel of a shape this cycle has now fixed twice — a redaction computed and discarded,
 * and `delegate()` consulting no guards at all. Each time the operator declared a guard, the run was
 * green, and one path the client reads was untouched.
 *
 * The fix is TWO passes and not a wider matcher, which is the part worth not re-deriving: two kinds
 * under one `extractText` COLLAPSE into one event, so the reasoning would be promoted into a visible
 * one — a disclosure created by the moderation. `test_matching_two_kinds_collapses_them_and_that_is_the_contract`
 * in `guardrails-output-stream.test.ts` pins that. (The name cited here for one round did not exist —
 * a fabricated citation caught by grepping for it.)

/**
 * B-004, seventh review round — a refusal that was documented and did not exist.
 *
 * `claudeCode.import` narrows WHICH surfaces of a foreign configuration root to read. Its docblock
 * said the narrowed form is "refused at resolve time" on an SDK older than 5.4.0. Nothing read a
 * version for it: the only two version checks in this layer are the hook gate (5.4.0, a different
 * option) and a compat-sources WARNING that returns silently for any major >= 5.
 *
 * So on 5.0.0 <= SDK < 5.4.0 — squarely inside this package's declared `^4.52.1 || ^5.0.0` — a
 * narrowed `import` was forwarded, dropped by the runtime in silence, and the foreign root was not
 * read AT ALL. A consumer asking for "the skills but not the hooks" got nothing, which is further
 * from what they asked for than the un-narrowed form would have been.
 *
 * `compatSources` itself landed in 5.0.0 and the NARROWED shape in 5.4.0. Treating those two
 * versions as one is the whole defect.
 */
/**
 * Compat sources are BRANDED, and the brand is mintable only by `resolveCompatSources`. These
 * fixtures therefore go through the real resolver instead of hand-building the value — which the
 * type now refuses, and which is the point: the field claimed "a value here can only hold a source
 * some posture granted" while a raw array reached it cast-free.
 *
 * Going through the resolver is also the stronger test. The narrowing these cases exercise is
 * produced by the same function production calls, so a change to its output shape fails here rather
 * than passing against a fixture nobody kept in step.

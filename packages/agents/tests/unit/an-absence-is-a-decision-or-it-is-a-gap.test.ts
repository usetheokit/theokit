/**
 * B-074 — an absence that reads as an oversight is re-investigated at full cost by the next person.
 *
 * The `.claude` sweep produced a table with absences in it, and shipping that without separating
 * "we decided not to" from "we have not got to it" reproduces the defect this backlog exists to
 * close. Four decisions across three files — `keybindings.json`, `themes/*.json`, and
 * `~/.claude.json` split into its two halves — are now declared where a reader meets them.
 *
 * ## Why the README and not only the rule
 *
 * `.claude/rules/foreign-config-surfaces.md` is this project's source of truth and is **gitignored**,
 * so nothing in it reaches somebody who installs the package. The README is the copy that travels.
 * A decision recorded only in the rule is a decision made for one checkout.
 *
 * ## Why a test at all
 *
 * Without one, the declaration is prose that nothing verifies, which is the same shape as the
 * capability-with-no-caller this backlog keeps finding — one genre over. These cases assert the
 * three properties the item's Definition of Done names, not the wording.

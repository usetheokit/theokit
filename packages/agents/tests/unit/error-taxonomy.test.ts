/**
 * M80 — the framework eats its own error contract.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `index.ts` re-exports `@theokit/sdk/errors` and `/retry` whole, with the reason written down:
 * without it the consumer was pushed into a PARALLEL hierarchy of five classes. The base was right.
 *
 * What was not right is that the framework did not obey it. Ten error classes under
 * `packages/agents/src` extended plain `Error`, and `isTransientError` is defined over
 * `TheokitAgentError` — so those ten were invisible to it, and the consumer's only recourse was the
 * string matching the rules forbid: a regex over an eight-level `cause` chain.
 *
 * Two of them were only fixed AFTER a consumer reported it. That is the shape this file exists to
 * change: a reactive fix becomes an invariant, the way `check-auth-parity.mjs` pins the pass-through
 * surfaces.
 *
 * ## Why a source scan and not a registry of known classes
 *
 * A list of classes to check is a list somebody forgets to append to — exactly how the last two got
 * through. Scanning the source for the SHAPE catches the class nobody remembered to register,
 * including one added tomorrow.

/**
 * Every source file, READ ONCE.

 * B-009: the walk ran at collection and the read ran inside one `it()`, so reading 147 files sat
 * inside vitest's 5-second per-test budget. Measured 2026-09-10: this file timed out at load average
 * 32.9 and passed idle minutes later — a failure indistinguishable from a regression until somebody
 * measured the load, which cost two investigations before anyone did.
 *
 * Reading once in a hook with its own allowance is the fix. Raising the per-test budget is not: it
 * moves the same failure to higher load, and CI runners are shared.
 *
 * The hook carries NO explicit timeout. It had `30_000`, which exceeded this item's own ceiling of
 * 15000ms, while vitest's default `hookTimeout` is 10000ms — verified against the installed vitest
 * rather than taken from documentation, by timing out a deliberately slow hook.
 *
 * The cost figure here is the hook AS IT NOW STANDS, and the correction matters because the first
 * version of this paragraph cited ~51ms — the cost BEFORE this same commit added five module
 * imports to it. Measured 2026-09-10: the file read is 4-5ms and the imports are 382-409ms, so the
 * hook costs ~390-410ms at load 3.5 and an independent measurement put it at ~1.3s at load 14. The
 * default leaves roughly 7x headroom at that load, not the two orders the old number implied.
 *
 * Quoting a stale figure in the paragraph whose subject is correcting flattering figures is the
 * defect this file is about, one level up.

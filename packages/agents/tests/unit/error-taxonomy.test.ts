/**
 * M80 — the framework eats its own error contract.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `index.ts` re-exports `@theokit/sdk/errors` and `/retry` whole, with the reason written down:
 * without it the consumer was pushed into a PARALLEL hierarchy of five classes. The base was right.
 *
 * What was not right is that the framework did not obey it. Ten error classes under
 * `packages/agents/src` extended plain `Error`, and `isTransientError` is defined over
 * `TheokitAgentError` — so those ten were invisible to it, and the consumer's only recourse was the
 * string matching the rules forbid: a regex over an eight-level `cause` chain.
 *
 * Two of them were only fixed AFTER a consumer reported it. That is the shape this file exists to
 * change: a reactive fix becomes an invariant, the way `check-auth-parity.mjs` pins the pass-through
 * surfaces.
 *
 * ## Why a source scan and not a registry of known classes
 *
 * A list of classes to check is a list somebody forgets to append to — exactly how the last two got
 * through. Scanning the source for the SHAPE catches the class nobody remembered to register,
 * including one added tomorrow.

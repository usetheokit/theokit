/**
 * M68 T4 — the trust gate has to sit ON the build path, not next to it.
 *
 * ## What was measured before this test existed
 *
 * `setting-sources-gate.ts` shipped a real gate: `resolveSettingSources(selection)` refuses
 * `project` unless a `TrustPosture` grants `projectSettings`. The CHANGELOG said so, and said
 * honestly that it was not wired yet.
 *
 * What it did NOT say is that `sdk-adapter-create-options.ts` declares a **local function of the
 * same name**, and that this one is what the build path calls. A grep for `resolveSettingSources`
 * finds the gate, its export, and its tests — and lands on a homonym that consults no posture at
 * all. The gate looked wired. That is worse than an absent gate, and it is the same defect shape
 * this codebase kept finding all cycle: the name promises what the oracle does not measure.
 *
 * ## Why this is the highest severity in the list
 *
 * `project` is the source that reads `<cwd>/.theokit/` — **including `hooks.json`, which executes
 * shell**. For the class of product this framework addresses (an agent whose `cwd` is a repository
 * the user just cloned) that content is attacker-controlled. Enabling `project` without evidence is
 * remote code execution on the first run.
 *
 * The two assertions below are the exploit, written as tests: an agent that never asked for
 * `project` gets it, and an agent that asks for it gets it without any posture being consulted.

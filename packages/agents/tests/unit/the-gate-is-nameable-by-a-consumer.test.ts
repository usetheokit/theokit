/**
 * theokit#686 — a public function whose parameter or error type does not cross the barrel is only
 * half delivered. A consumer can call it and cannot name what it takes, nor catch what it throws.
 *
 * This is the FOURTH instance of the same shape, and the first three were each found by installing
 * the published package rather than by reading the source — because the source is correct every
 * time: the type IS exported from its own module, and only the barrel omits it.
 *
 *   #663  AgentModule           parameter of `streamAgentTurnInProcess`
 *   #668  transcriptOf          the migration path for a renamed map
 *   #675  RegistryOutcome       the union `registryOutcome` is typed as
 *   #686  HookApprovalGate      what `HookApprovalCapability` takes, and the error it throws
 *
 * Reading the BUILT declaration is the point. `export type` inside a module satisfies the compiler,
 * the unit tests, and the reviewer; only the emitted barrel says what a consumer can reach.

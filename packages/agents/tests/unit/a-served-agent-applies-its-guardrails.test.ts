/**
 * An agent served over HTTP or the terminal applied none of its declared guardrails.
 *
 * `streamAgentUIMessages` calls `createSdkAgentStream` directly, on both its paths. Guardrails are
 * applied in exactly two other places — `AgentRunner.stream()` and `withGuardrails`, the latter
 * reached only from `toAgentFactory` — so a `defineAgent({ guardrails: [...] })` served to a browser
 * ran no input guard, applied no `redact`, and a `block` never threw. Measured:
 * `grep -c guardrail agent-endpoint.ts` → 0, against 23 files in `packages/agents/src`.
 *
 * Its reachable callers are the HTTP mount, the terminal runner and the streamer builder — every
 * surface a deployed agent is actually reached through.
 *
 * This is the same shape as three defects already closed in this release, one layer up: a safety
 * property that holds on the path somebody looked at. B-014 and B-018 measured CHANNELS inside a
 * stream that was already being moderated; this is the surface where the moderation never starts.
 *
 * ## The composition is copied deliberately, not invented
 *
 * Two passes over two text-EVENT kinds, `text_delta` inner and `thinking` outer, exactly as
 * `AgentRunner.stream()` composes them. NOT one wider `extractText`: two kinds under one extractor
 * COLLAPSE into a single event, so the model's private reasoning would be promoted into a visible
 * one — the moderation would create the disclosure it exists to close.

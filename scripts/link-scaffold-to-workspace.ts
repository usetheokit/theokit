/**
 * Point a scaffolded app at THIS working tree instead of at npm.
 *
 * `pnpm try:scaffold` exists so this repository can try its own scaffold, and it did the opposite
 * (usetheokit/theokit#420): the template pins ranges — correctly, for the people who scaffold from
 * npm — and a caret on a `0.x` version pins the MINOR, so `^0.48.3` means `>=0.48.3 <0.49.0` and
 * excluded the 0.49.0 the repository had already reached. Every local verification run through that
 * script had been measuring the published package.
 *
 * The sharp edge was not that it missed the local build; it is that it missed only SOME of it.
 * `@theokit/agents ^10.1.0` matched the workspace `10.1.0` and linked, so one scaffolded app could
 * pair a local agent runtime with a published framework — a combination that fails in ways neither
 * version exhibits alone, and whose failure reads as a framework bug.
 *
 * This rewrites the app's manifest to the `workspace:` protocol. That is deliberate rather than
 * "bump the template range to match": a range has to be bumped in lockstep with every release, and
 * bump-in-lockstep is precisely the mechanism that failed here. `workspace:*` carries no version to
 * drift, and pnpm honours the protocol explicitly — so the result does not depend on
 * `link-workspace-packages`, whose default the issue could not determine and which no longer
 * matters here.
 *
 * The TEMPLATE is untouched. It is copied verbatim into applications outside this monorepo, where
 * `workspace:*` resolves to nothing; the rewrite belongs to the harness, not to the product.

/**
 * Build `packages/theo` BEFORE vitest starts, not from inside it.
 *
 * ## Why it is out here
 *
 * Seven test files need a built `dist/` and each called `buildTheokitPackageOnce()` lazily, so the
 * first one to meet a cold dist built it while the rest of the suite was already running. Measured
 * 2026-09-11: the build is **21s** on an idle machine, and full root runs died twice on the helper's
 * 240s timeout with `Terminated`, taking `devtools-entry-dist` and `r3a-emitted-bundle-node-free`
 * with them.
 *
 * A `globalSetup` was tried first and is NOT what shipped. It measured **20.6s** with all 997 files
 * — so vitest's own startup was never competing with the build, which was the hypothesis — and two
 * cold runs still died at the 240s gate under conditions that were named but never reproduced. A fix
 * whose mechanism is not understood is not a fix.
 *
 * Out here there is nothing to reason about: the build owns the machine, finishes, and vitest starts
 * afterwards. The failure mode it removes is structural rather than statistical.
 *
 * ## The freshness skip is NOT bypassed
 *
 * This calls the same helper the tests call, so a warm dist costs a `stat` rather than a build. The
 * decision still lives in `isDistUsableWithoutRebuilding` and is not reimplemented here — that logic
 * (a per-run marker plus a ten-minute window) was written to fix a real race and duplicating it
 * would be the DRY violation that matters: two copies of one piece of knowledge.
 *
 * The per-run marker is keyed on the run id this script's caller exports, `THEOKIT_TEST_RUN_ID`.
 * Every script that runs this gate before vitest begins with `export THEOKIT_TEST_RUN_ID=$$;`, so
 * the marker written here vouches for dist to every worker of the vitest run that follows, and no
 * worker re-decides by the clock (B-700). Without the variable the id is this process's parent
 * pid, which no vitest worker shares.
 *
 * ## What still runs lazily, deliberately
 *
 * `npx vitest run` invoked directly bypasses this script. The seven call sites keep their lazy
 * `buildTheokitPackageOnce()`, so that path still works — it simply pays the old contention. Making
 * the script the only path would mean deleting a fallback to protect an invocation nobody is
 * obliged to use.
